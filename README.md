"The Odin Project's" Calculator Project: The objective is to create a calculator with a user-interface, that takes two numbers and an operator as arguments and then "operates" on them with the '=' button in the UI to produces the desired arithmetic. I will attempt a calculator that can take many, or virtually any number of arguments if possible.
